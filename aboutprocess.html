<h3>Very often I receive questions concerning the process of creating my teddies. I’ve collected the most frequently asked questions here and tried to answer them in details.</h3>
<br/>
<h3>Why did you decide to make exactly bears?</h3>
<p>As I’ve written in the topic “About Artist”, designer's bears came to my life all of a sudden. They just looked at me from the computer’s screen. And after 3 days of monitoring the Internet, I got enthusiastic about the idea to make a classic Teddy bear as my Mum’s birthday present.</p>
<p>Mum often told me about some favorite bear she had in her childhood. “Big, light, with the revolving limbs and it roared!" – said Mum. Mind that there almost weren’t toys in my childhood, and later appeared Chinese toys of poor quality. That’s why I can’t understand how it was possible – a bear with revolving limbs… Only in 2009 I’ve understood what that bear looked like.</p>
<p>That’s how I started to sew Teddy bears, and it was impossible to stop.</p>
<p>From that moment I’ve tried different kinds of creativity, but none of them could carry me away for more than a couple of weeks.</p>
<h3>What was an incitement to you to start making miniature Teddy bears?</h3>
<p>Oh, this is a funny story! When I saw the first miniature bear, I thought that it’s really cool, but I definitely would never be able to do like that! So I proceeded to sew normal-sized teddies from 20 to 40 cm and forgotten about the miniature ones.</p>
<p>And once during end of an exhibition in Moscow I saw my friend Julia Ovtsyna took all the rest little bears put them in a metal cookie box, put it into her bag and went home! I was so fascinated, that I decided to try as soon as I return to Ekatherinburg.</p>
<h3>What is more appropriate to you: to sew by yourself or to sew on a machine?</h3>
<p>I rarely sew on a machine. For me it’s faster and more convenient to sew parts by myself. Besides that, I often sew teddies’ details together not at home but wherever possible, when I have a spare minute: staying in a queue, sitting on a beach or in a park, in plane, in train, in a café waiting for lunch and so on. Almost always I have workpieces, threads of the same colour, needle and scissors on me. <a href="http://abcbears.blogspot.ru/2013/06/blog-post_19.html">Here</a> you can see photos about this fact.</p>
<p>I use a sewing machine for making big bears. I make limbs and body on a machine but head and little details I sew by myself.</p>
<h3>Do you invent patterns by yourself? If so, how do you do it?</h3>
<p>All ABCbears teddies are sewn by my own patterns.</p>
<p>When I want to create a new character, I start to sculpt from the prototypical plasticine. I can spent a couple of hours or months or even a year. If I pleased with the result I make a paper pattern from it in a particular way. And only after I start to work with the materials.</p>
<img src="/img/about/aboutprocess01.jpg">
<h3>Where do you find an inspiration?</h3>
<p>I consider inspiration is in everything that surrounds us. I can talk about it for hours.</p>
<p>I’m inspired by nature, travelling, new acquaintances…</p>
<p>Sometimes one irrational purchase made during a trip becomes a start of a new collection. Sometimes I’m collecting accessories for months in hope to get inspired to make a new teddy. I can spend a couple of hours at the souvenir shop looking for the appropriate little thing for bears.</p>
<p>Soviet cartoons and books for children exert a huge impact on me, because they’re made with a great love. Their plot, style, humour are brilliant! They are so colourful and kind for real! They are my eternal source of inspiration and positive thoughts!</p>
<p>Also I always observe what is happening around and carry my notebook on me to write down and draw my ideas as they come to my mind.</p>
<h3>When has your own author's style formed?</h3>
<p>Frankly speaking, it’s hard to say when exactly it happened.</p>
<p>At the beginning I was worried about it. It seemed to me that I’m sewing somebody else’s bears, that I take somebody else’s style. I was afraid to be accused of plagiarism.</p> 
<p>That’s why I was constantly looking for something mine, left undone bears (I even had a hole suitcase of separate bears' parts), tried over and over.</p>
<p>Before my first exhibition I mastered cutting patterns from the plasticine models. That made my works be remarkable, so I became salient. But still my works lacked in charisma and special appeal.</p>
<p>I think my first identical work was the first miniature elephant. It was sewn in the summer of 2011.</p>
<h3>Do you have any people to help you with the ABCbears? If so, what kind of help do you receive?</h3>
<p>In general I deal with all processes and aspects of ABCbears.</p>
<p>At the beginning I thought that to make Teddy bears means just to sew them. Now I’m a seamstress, a graphic designer, a photographer, a supply-manager, a sales-manager, an organizer, a copywriter, a PR-manager and a postman.</p>
<p>But there are some moments I can’t work out myself. That’s why I regularly cooperate with professionals.</p>
<p>I’m very obliged to my friend <a href="https://vk.com/phmaxfomin">Max Fomin</a>, a photographer, for many beautiful photos in the website. He also consults me about the object photography when I need it.</p>
<p>Once I was acquainted to <a href="http://www.livemaster.ru/emerald">Aleena Razumkova</a> who makes accessories from glass in the lampwork technique. We were so impressed by each other creativity that we decided to cooperate. As a result Aleena supplies ABCbears with different handmade beads, in particular made from my scratches.</p>
<p>Specially for you I and my photographer made photos of making a piglet’s snout process:</p>

</div>
<p>I would become mad because of the computer work’s amount unless my Husband helped me. He is the major ABCbears’ IT-specialist. He deals with the site’s development, support, promotion and many routine computer processes’ automation and new software mastering.</p>
<p>Besides, sometimes I involve my parents in the process. That’s how my bears get knitted things and wooden accessories.</p>
<h3>Is it easy for you to part with you creations?</h3>
<p>It’s easy to part only with ordered teddies. But I stopped work to order at the beginning of 2014. It’s hard to part with other creations but I know this is vital for my professional growth.</p>
